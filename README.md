# bun-plugin-blade

> Blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine provided with Stacks.

## Features

- ðŸ¦‹ Laravel Blade-like
- ðŸš€ Fast and lightweight
- ðŸ“¦ Zero config

## Usage

```bash
bun install -d bun-plugin-blade
```

### Bundler

You may now use the plugin now via `Bun.build`:

```ts
// build.ts
import type { UserConfig } from 'blade'
import { plugin as blade } from 'bun-plugin-blade'
// import blade from 'bun-plugin-blade'

Bun.build({
  entrypoints: ['./src/index.html'],
  outdir: './dist',
  plugins: [
    blade,
  ],
})
```

### Server

Additionally, it can also be used in conjunction with HTML imports, via `Bun.serve()`:

```ts
// server.ts
import home from './home.html'

const server = Bun.serve({
  static: {
    // Bundle & route home.html to "/home"
    '/': home,
  },

  async fetch(req) {
    console.log('any other request', req.url)

    // Return 404 for unmatched routes
    return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 })
  },
})

console.log(`Listening on ${server.url}`)
```

```html
<!-- home.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>Home</title>
</head>

<body>
  <div @if="true">Is this shown?</div>
</body>

</html>
```

#### Configuration

For this to work, though, you have to ensure that the plugin is defined in your `bunfig.toml`:

```toml
[serve.static]
plugins = [ "bun-plugin-blade" ]
```

## Testing

```bash
bun test
```
